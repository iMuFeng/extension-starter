## Usage

### Folders

- `src` - main source.
  - `contentScript` - scripts and components to be injected as `content_script`
  - `background` - scripts for background.
  - `options` - scripts for options page.
  - `styles` - styles shared in popup and options page
  - `assets` - assets used in React components
- `manifest.config.ts` - manifest for the extension.
- `dist` - extension package root.

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then **load extension in browser with the `dist/` folder**.

For Firefox developers, you can run the following command instead:

```bash
pnpm start:firefox
```

`web-ext` auto reload the extension when `dist/` files changed.

### Build

To build the extension, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And then pack files under `dist`, you can upload `extension.crx` or `extension.xpi` to appropriate extension store.
